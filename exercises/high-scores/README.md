# High Scores
Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate primitive and complex arrays. Java arrays are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

## Running the tests
To run the tests, run the appropriate command below in your terminal:

```sh
gradle test
```

- Use gradlew.bat if you're on Windows

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the @Ignore("Remove to run test") annotation.

## Submitting Exercises
